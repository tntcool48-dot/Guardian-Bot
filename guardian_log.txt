Smart Fall & Death Guard

Fall Guard (Y-Level Check): The bot now understands Gravity. It will no longer panic and trigger a "Stuck" alarm if your X/Z coordinates stop moving while you are falling.

Instant Void Recovery: Added a specialized handle_death() system.

    Old Behavior: Died -> Waited for slow server check -> Panicked on respawn wall hit.

    New Behavior: Detects "fell into the void" -> Instantly grants immunity to wall collisions -> Waits 4s for respawn -> Resumes immediately without warping.
    
    Full Config Persistence: The launcher now remembers all your settings, including:

Turn Style (Yazan vs. Cizare)

Operation Mode (Normal vs. Test)

Monitor Selection
